# `tinywasm-wasmparser`

No_std compatible fork of the [wasmparser (200.0.0)](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools) crate for internal use in the tinywasm project.
Since there doesn't seem to be interest in making the original crate no_std compatible (see [issue](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/364)), this fork was created. There's also anoter [no_std fork](https://crates.io/crates/wasmparser_nostd) of the original crate, but it's not actively maintained.
